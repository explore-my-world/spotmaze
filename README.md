# Welcome to the Spotmaze Repository
Spotmaze is a virtual world creation platform that enables you to build and customize your own personalized virtual worlds.

## How it works?
You first create a grid of connected locations and pathways. These are meant to represent any topics that are closely related. Each location can be then be linked to a forum, where you can receive responses from your community. You can then share this world using a simple URL.

## Launch your world
To launch your world, copy/fork the spotmaze.json file into your own repository named spotmaze. Go to https://spotmaze.world/MY_USERNAME
To refresh your world, you can rename your file to "myFile.json" and query the URL https://spotmaze.world/MY_USERNAME?myFile.json. To embed background images at locations into your world, you can drag and drop your images into the repository. You can further customize your world by editing the appropriate fields in your spotmaze.json file. For in-game debugging, turn on the grid in the Developer section and press backspace to open the console.
